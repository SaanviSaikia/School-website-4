I to IX on 7/11/2022(Thursday).able to improve my time management skills, my creative skills, and my presentation skills. Completing a science fair project is a lengthy process.

      Students at New Era are served a nutritious and balanced diet that is tasty and includes a variety of items. We offer both vegetarian and non-vegetarian fare. These are prepared separately and served at dedicated vegetarian and non-vegetarian dining halls.
      A regular meal includes pulses, rice, chapatti, vegetables, dairy products, fruit and salad. Non-vegetarian meals are served three times a week during dinner and breakfast. Snacks are served twice a day, morning and afternoon. The day ends with a nourishing glass of milk. On festival days a special menu is served.
      To ensure that children eat properly, maintain a peaceful atmosphere and follow table etiquette they are supervised by dorm-parents, staff and Department Heads.</p>

    The administration of schools has started sending messages to parents informing that classes will run in online mode until further notice. A school teacher said, “We are ready for children to come back to school. But, the attendance of children is so low that it is not wise to start physical classes again. So, it was decided that we will switch to online mode for the time being.”
    <br>
Teachers said that parents want to send their children only after they are vaccinated. “After suffering three Covid waves parents are scared and they don't want to take any chance,” a teacher said. On the other hand, parents said that sending children to school is not possible now, as the third wave is at its peak. “As a parent, I can't take chance with my child.
